                  Fusion faced increasing pressure from competitors who already

                  becoming the default expectation for any modern product, and
                  mobilizing Fusion had the potential to grow adoption and sales
                  significantly.

                <p>
                  Autodesk Fusion helps users manufacture products, supporting
                  the end-to-end workflow. Users range from large mining
                  equipment manufacturers to footwear designers. While best
                  known for its 3D design environment, Fusion has acquired many
                  technologies over the years, adding workspaces like
                  simulation, generative design, electronics, and drawings. It
                  also has a robust data management system.

                This project required a dual strategy: developing capabilities

                experiences.

                      Working with our user researcher, we created a
                      Practitioner Value Framework based on comprehensive user
                      surveys. This revealed that to drive adoption, we needed
                      to focus on <strong>features/functionality</strong> and
                      deliver an exceptional <strong>user experience</strong>.

                      A crucial insight emerged: users wanted to perform the
                      same types of tasks on all devices, but the complexity and
                      duration of these tasks scaled based on device mobility.

                    <h4>Task Rationalization: Consumption vs Creation</h4>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Consumption Tasks:</strong> Analyze documents,
                      view markups, analyze 3D models, view tasks from project
                      manager
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Creation Tasks:</strong> Create 3D models, create
                      renderings, create toolpaths, adjust 3D models
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Insight:</strong> Consumption tasks are naturally
                      more mobile-friendly than creation tasks, informing our
                      progressive disclosure strategy.

                During user testing of our surface prototype, several users
                suggested moving the navigation bar to the top-right corner next
                to the view cube. This feedback prompted a comprehensive
                research and redesign effort.

                Research revealed that leading CAD and 3D tools place navigation
                controls near the ViewCube, typically in the upper right on
                desktop, web, and tablet. This validated our direction and
                aligned with user mental models from other similar software.

                  While I wasn't able to see this product launched during my
                  tenure, the foundation and architecture I established should
                  be released by the end of 2025. The comprehensive research,
                  testing, and design work provides a solid foundation for
                  Autodesk Fusion's device-independent future.
