                  Autodesk Fusion was powerful. Complex. And trapped on desktop.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For years, this wasn't a problem—until our competitors
                  launched mobile and web experiences while we watched potential
                  customers slip away. Manufacturing engineers couldn't access
                  their designs on the factory floor. Distributed teams
                  struggled with workflow continuity. Product designers wanted
                  tablet flexibility but had no option.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>The stakes were existential:</strong> We faced a
                  potential 5-10 year subscription loss to mobile-first
                  competitors. But the real challenge cut deeper.

                  <strong>2 researchers</strong>, multiple product managers, and

                  Regular cross-team coordination was essential for success. I

            <p>
              I ran a workshop with 20 users representing design, manufacturing,
              engineering, and electronics roles. For an hour, we explored how
              they used CAD tools across their workflows, diving into seven
              dimensions of software adoption.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Adopting progressive disclosure as a core principle, I developed
              an architecture that scales intelligently—keeping Fusion's power
              accessible on every device while using available space effectively
              on larger screens.

              The key was creating a system where UI elements adapt based on:

            class="project-section"
            id="toolbar-redesign"

            aria-labelledby="toolbar-heading"
          >
            <h2 id="toolbar-heading">Deep Dive: The Toolbar Redesign</h2>
            <p>
              The toolbar is Fusion's command center—central to nearly every
              workflow. Transforming it was critical.
            </p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>The legacy toolbar had several issues:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Consumed too much vertical space on smaller devices</li>
              <li>
                Commands became buried unpredictably when horizontal space
                narrowed
              </li>
              <li>Fixed top position failed to adapt across screen sizes</li>
              <li>Inconsistent across different workspaces</li>
              <li>Not scalable for touch interfaces</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research: Optimal Placement</h3>
            <p>
              I approached toolbar placement from an ergonomic perspective,
              considering how users naturally interact with each device type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through user testing with 22 participants across design,
              manufacturing, engineering, and electronics roles, I discovered:
            </p>

            <div class="placement-findings grid grid--3-column">
              <div class="finding card--white">
                <h4>Tablet</h4>
                <p>
                  Left placement won decisively—users wanted easy thumb access
                  in both portrait and landscape
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="finding card--white">
                <h4>Desktop/Web</h4>
                <p>Top placement aligned with familiar patterns</p>
              </div>
              <div class="finding card--white">
                <h4>Mobile</h4>
                <p>
                  Results were mixed between left/top, so I flagged for ongoing
                  testing
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              Before redesigning the interface, I needed to solve the
              information architecture. I took a multifaceted approach,
              analyzing:

              <div class="analysis-factor card--outline">
                <h4>Hierarchy</h4>
                <p>
                  Application-level vs. document-level vs. workspace-specific

              </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Card Sorting Insights</h4>
            <p>
              Users classified tools by function and usage. They wanted related
              tools grouped together, not scattered across different menus. This
              led to reorganizing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Navigation commands</strong> → Near the ViewCube</li>
              <li><strong>View options</strong> → Grouped in ViewCube menu</li>
              <li><strong>Display settings</strong> → Directly on toolbar</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Rarely-used settings</strong> → Moved to preferences
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Named views</strong> → Relocated from model browser to
                view menu
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Solution</h3>
            <p>
              After analyzing modern CAD tools, I recognized a pattern: most
              prioritize condensed, icon-driven interfaces with overflow menus.
            </p>

            <p>I designed a new toolbar where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All commands are accessible through a dropdown on the right
              </li>
              <li>
                As the toolbar narrows, it predictably hides commands from the
                right
              </li>
              <li>Overflow dropdown stays in the same place</li>
              <li>
                Users can search and browse with collapsible sections and grid
                view
              </li>
              <li>Toolbar can collapse entirely to maximize canvas space</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="card--outline">
              <h4>Validation</h4>
              <p>I conducted moderated testing with 5 users:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>5 of 5</strong> successfully switched from Constrained

                  The navigation toolbar fit users' mental models, confirming
                  prior research

            class="project-section"
            id="sketch-workflow"

            <h2 id="sketch-heading">Deep Dive: 2D Sketch Workflow</h2>
            <p>
              One of the toughest challenges was designing 2D Sketching for
              touch devices. 2D sketching is like creating architectural plans
              for 3D shapes—precision is essential.
            </p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>The legacy workflow relied heavily on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cursor and hover feedback</li>
              <li>Text inputs for exact values</li>
              <li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Without a keyboard and mouse, I needed to completely rethink the
              experience.
            </p>

            <h3>The Precise Cursor</h3>
            <p>
              After reviewing competitors, I noticed they placed a precise
              cursor just above the finger, functioning like a mouse cursor.
            </p>

            <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
            <p>
              I explored multiple cursor designs—through internal design
              critiques, I kept returning to plus (+) variants as most precise
              and least intrusive. The breakthrough came with a centered square
              inside the plus icon, providing optimal precision without
              compromising canvas clarity.
            </p>

            <h4>Interaction Pattern</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Double-tap</strong> activates the precise cursor</li>
              <li>Users position the cursor</li>
              <li><strong>Lift finger</strong> to complete selection</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="card--outline">
              <h4>Validation</h4>
              <p>
                Testing with 5 users showed the double-tap gesture became second
                nature after a single demonstration, with a usefulness rating of
                <strong>4.1 out of 5</strong>. Users repeatedly used it
                throughout the prototype session.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Exiting Sketch Mode</h3>
            <p>
              Using state charts to map user flows, I uncovered a critical gap:
              the only way to exit a Sketch tool was pressing Escape.
            </p>

            <p>
              I needed an exit pattern that worked across all input types. The
              solution:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Blue call-to-action button with white icon</li>
              <li>Placed directly in toolbar</li>
              <li>
                Same icon and button style connects toolbar and command panel
              </li>
              <li>Makes it immediately clear users are in a special mode</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="supporting-features grid grid--2-column">

              Exploring Beyond Constraints
            </h2>
            <p>
              During this project, I stepped back for a thought experiment:
              <em
                >What if Fusion was designed from scratch today with
                multi-device in mind from the start?</em
              >
            </p>

            <p>Freed from legacy constraints, I explored:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Unconventional interaction patterns</li>
              <li>Motion design principles for progressive disclosure</li>
              <li>Alternative visual styles and hierarchies</li>
              <li>High and low density modes</li>
              <li>Light and dark themes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Drawing from these experimental designs, I integrated:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rounded corners and subtle drop shadows</li>
              <li>Floating elements creating an open, modern feel</li>
              <li>Spaciousness and accessibility as core principles</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The feedback from leadership and users indicated I had captured
              Fusion's future style and direction—concepts that influenced the
              broader product vision.

                  When I gave myself permission to explore untested ideas and
                  unconventional approaches, it became easier to narrow in on
                  solutions that were not only inventive but also simpler and
                  more intuitive for users.

                  This project reaffirmed the importance of engaging directly
                  with users and actively listening to their insights. When
                  prompted with thoughtful questions, users consistently offered
                  valuable feedback and innovative ideas that shaped the final
                  solution.

                  This fundamental insight unlocked the entire strategy. Rather
                  than creating separate experiences for each platform,
                  recognizing that users want the same capabilities at different
                  scales of complexity led to a truly unified, scalable
                  solution.
