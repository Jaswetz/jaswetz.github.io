                  The original Autodesk Fusion was designed exclusively for
                  desktop environments, with a complex interface optimized for
                  mouse and keyboard interactions. While powerful, its dense UI
                  and specialized controls limited accessibility and confined
                  users to traditional workstations.

                  tablet, web, and desktop platforms. With thoughtful
                  architecture and support for multiple input methods (touch,
                  stylus, and mouse), giving Fusion a path to empower creators
                  to design anywhere, on any device.

          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Autodesk Fusion is exclusively available as a desktop application
            for Mac and Windows. While the software provides robust
            functionality, its complex interface is optimized solely for mouse
            and keyboard interactions, limiting its usability across other
            devices. There was no established cross-platform strategy to extend
            its reach and move it onto every device.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The goal of this multiyear project was two fold:</strong>
          </p>

            <li class="card--outline">
              <strong>Redefine Fusion as a device-independent product</strong>
              with an experience that scales seamlessly across mobile, tablet,
              web, and desktop platforms.

                >Lay the foundation for a cross-platform design system </strong
              >that could serve as a framework for future Autodesk products,
              accommodating diverse input methods such as touch, stylus, and
              mouse.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            As the Lead Designer, I worked alongside two senior designers, to
            explore, test, and build cross-platform solutions. This initiative
            required close collaboration with all other UX design teams and
            cross-functional teams over several years to align on strategy,
            design principles, and technical feasibility.
