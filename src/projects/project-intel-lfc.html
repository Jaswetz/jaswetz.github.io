                I spearheaded the UX design for Intel's groundbreaking Immersive
                Media project, aiming to revolutionize soccer fan engagement
                through cutting-edge technology. Within a challenging six-month
                timeframe, I led a cross-functional team to develop a native
                Android and iOS application, navigating complex stakeholder
                requirements and a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

              <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The primary challenges we encountered in this project were:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Conflicting stakeholder needs:</strong> Balancing the
                  requirements of three different stakeholder groups with
                  varying priorities and expectations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Tight timeline:</strong> Delivering a complete native
                  application for both iOS and Android within just 6 months.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fan engagement:</strong> Creating an application that
                  would meaningfully boost fan engagement with soccer content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Undefined requirements:</strong> Working with unclear
                  feature definitions and requirements from Intel, requiring
                  extensive discovery work.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section

              <h2>Define Business Objectives</h2>
              <p>
                Intel had a very narrow idea of what they wantedâ€”additionally
                LFC had their own requirements. This project was also being used
                by Intel as a study on how they could use their technology to
                engage fans for other teams and other sports.
              </p>
              <p>
                We did not have much time so it was crucial to download as much
                information as possible and clarify the business objectives as
                soon as possible. This was done through a series of discovery
                meetings and stakeholder interviews.
              </p>
              <p>We defined our business objectives as the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Increase fan engagement and loyalty</strong> by
                  providing access to personalized content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Solidify leadership in immersive media landscape</strong
                  >
                  by dynamically delivering FreeD (360-degree volumetric video)
                  and Voke (VR) content to fans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Increase adoption rate of Intel's products</strong> by
                  connecting with a broader audience.
                </li>

              <h2>Define Process</h2>
              <p>
                I've learned over my career that each project is unique and
                there is never a standard process. Therefore, I find it critical
                to define and align with my team on the best process for the
                particular project.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the Intel project we decided that creating a Deliverables
                Map would be the best way to ensure that we were aligned on the
                process and would achieve our goal. We customized our process to
                balance business objectives with user needs and to make sure
                that the features we defined could be built by development in
                the short time period we had.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Deliverables Map illustrated what we needed to do to
                accomplish our end goal. Providing a high-level overview of
                major milestones, the Map allowed us to track where we are in
                the process, and identify and expose potential risks and
                blockers early on in the process.

                Defining what an MVP will look like took many meetings,
                brainstorming sessions, white boarding, and iterating on very
                crude wireframes. Once we had a loose idea of which features
                were needed to meet the business requirements, which features we
                thought would engage our users, and understood what was
                technically feasible in this short timeline, it was time to
                iterate on wireframes.

                  Here, the PO and I made a list of features, refined the list,
                  and then prioritized the features for a MVP and for later
                  releases.

              </figure>

              <p>
                Continuing on the iterative feature building process, I wanted
                to get an idea of how the features will be sorted in the app so
                I made a site map using the MVP feature set to help define the
                application's information architecture.

              <h2>Wireframing, Prototyping And User Interviews</h2>
              <p>
                We needed to validate that the features we defined for MVP would
                excite and engage the user, as well as meet their needs. To do
                this, we needed to put together a rough prototype for users to
                test once we began our research.
              </p>

              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../img/projects/lfc/wireframes.png"
                  alt="Wireframes of the app"
                  class="wireframe-image project__img"
                />
                <figcaption>
                  Rough wireframes fleshing out the backbone of the app.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                So I took these wireframes and began to create the prototypes
                that we would use for the interviews. We defined the four main
                features that we wanted to demo to users:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Filtering</strong> - How a user would search through
                  games to find certain plays.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Live-Match</strong> - How a live game would be handled
                  in the app.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Post-Match</strong> - How a match that happened in the
                  past would be presented.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sharing</strong> - How sharing would work in the app.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                I decided to do these prototypes in Principle because Principle
                gave me the ability to make the prototype feel like a real
                native app; I utilized animations and page transitions to convey
                the most realistic experience of the app to users during
                interviews.
              </p>

              <h2>User Interviews</h2>
              <p>
                We created a screener in Google forms and recruited most of our
                interviewees from social media. Some of the members of our team
                were avid soccer fans so it was easy to get access to the
                Facebook Groups we needed to access and target the participants
                we needed. We offered $50 to help us out and had enough
                participants in no time. We decided to do 6 interviews, all in
                person.
              </p>
              <p>
                The prototype validated our theories on what would excite and
                engage users. Now that our assumptions were confirmed, it was
                time to dive deep into defining the design and the UX of the
                entire application on both iOS and Android.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section class="project-designing" id="designing">
              <h2>Designing The Complete App</h2>
              <p>
                So far we had designed what I would call a branded wireframe for
                the prototype. We had not dived deeply into the design or how
                features would really work. Our goal for the designs so far were
                to convey to users and some stakeholders what our main features
                would be and validate that these features would meet the
                business goals and not only meet the users needs but engage
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                I began by creating a task flow which eventually turned into
                user flow shown below. I kept the user flow updated as I updated
                the comps. It was a great resource for the team and developers
                to reference.
              </p>

              <p>
                During the design I would frequently go back to pen and paper to
                iterate on different ideas and brainstorm on how features may
                work. A few examples are below:
              </p>

                  src="../img/projects/lfc/sketching-1.png"
                  alt="Sketches of the app"
                  class="sketch-image project__img"
                />
                <figcaption>
                  Iterations on switching between video formats.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../img/projects/lfc/sketching-2.png"
                  alt="Sketches of the app"
                  class="sketch-image project__img"
                />
                <figcaption>
                  Iterations on switching between video formats.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                I designed the app in Sketch and by default I create a clickable
                prototype to accompany my designs. This helps me grasp the flow
                of the design better and make sure I am not leaving out any
                pages or states. Using invision to do this, the prototype also
                helped me easily share the flow and design with members of my
                team.
              </p>

              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../img/projects/lfc/high-level-proto.png"
                  alt="Overview of a prototype made in Sketch app"
                  class="prototype-overview-image project__img"
                />
                <figcaption>Overview of the Prototype.</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                Once I was satisfied that I had covered every page and state of
                the app it was time to work with the devs and translate the
                design.

                I collaborated closely with both iOS and Android development
                teams to ensure accurate translation of the client's vision and
                my designs into the app. By pairing and working directly with
                the developers, we minimized confusion and misinterpretations.
                Additionally, I created Principle videos to illustrate animation
                concepts, fostering a collaborative back-and-forth exchange of
                animation ideas with the developers. This enjoyable and
                productive collaboration with both teams added that special
                polish that elevated the app to the next level.

              <h2>Outcome</h2>
              <p>
                Considering all of the constraints and challenges of this
                project, this project was a great success. We were able to build
                an app that met all of the client's technical requirements, that
                users found engaging, and that all within our given timeframe
                and budget. It was a very fast paced project, but defining the
                process early on, and keeping the team engaged and focused on
                our end goal helped us reach the finish line and start the
                conversation for a Phase 2. The client even wrote an awesome
                poem on how satisfied they were with what we delivered (which I
                wish I had to show you)!
