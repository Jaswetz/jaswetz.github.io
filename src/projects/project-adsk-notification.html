          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Notifications were a non-standardized mess causing confusion,
            reduced growth opportunities, and a bad taste with customers,
            risking brand quality and customer loyalty.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>User Experience:</strong> The inconsistent volume of
              notifications disrupted workflows, creating an overwhelming
              experience. Users struggled to prioritize information and
              efficiently manage in-app communication.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Impact:</strong> Key communications, particularly
              those related to subscriber acquisition, were being lost in the
              noise, significantly reducing their impact on business goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Product Perception:</strong> The lack of a cohesive
              notification experience detracted from the perceived quality and
              coherence of Autodesk Fusion, presenting an unpolished and
              fragmented appearance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Internal Friction:</strong> The absence of a unified
              notification strategy increased development complexity and led to
              redundant implementation efforts, making the notification system
              difficult to manage and evolve.

            <h3>Discovery & Research</h3>
            <p>
              Recognizing Fusion's fragmented messaging hurt user engagement, I
              initiated an investigation. A thorough content inventory of
              existing notifications, affinity mapping, and review of the
              Autodesk Design System (Weave) and other products helped identify
              inconsistencies. User research highlighted key frustrations:
              overuse/repetition, bad content, difficult access, lack of user
              control, and too many channels.

            <h3>Framework Development & Design</h3>
            <p>
              I created a severity matrix and notification categories to guide
              delivery methods. After securing stakeholder buy-in, I moved from
              rapid sketches to high-fidelity designs using Weave components.
              This led to defining a centralized Notification Center, combining
              flyout and toast notifications, and exploring features like
              filtering, collapsible sections, and bulk actions, while
              addressing design challenges like filter scalability and visual
              clarity.

              Usability sessions were conducted to evaluate the current system
              and validate the new Notification Center concept. Key hypotheses
              around centralization, intuitiveness of flyouts/toasts, and
              workflow disruption were tested. Findings informed iterative
              improvements, prioritizing critical feedback for the initial
              version and deferring some enhancements.

          <h2>A Centralized Solution</h2>
          <p>
            My work successfully transformed Fusion's notifications from a
            source of user frustration into a strategic communication tool. I
            designed a centralized notification center that reduced user
            distraction. Coupled with clear guidelines and prioritization
            strategies, this demonstrably reduced user distraction and improved
            the overall clarity of in-app messaging. The solution involved
            high-severity messages appearing as toasts, less critical ones
            stored in a flyout, and intermediate messages briefly appearing as
            toasts before moving to the flyout, minimizing workflow disruption.

          <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The critical importance of a unified messaging strategy was
              underscored; fragmented systems invariably lead to user
              frustration and missed business opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Iterative design, strongly backed by comprehensive user research
              and continuous stakeholder buy-in, is paramount when redesigning
              complex systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developing and providing clear guidelines alongside reusable
              design components significantly empowers other teams, fostering
              consistency and efficiency across the product ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
              A deep understanding of user pain points through direct research
              and analytics is fundamental to designing solutions that genuinely
              improve user experience and achieve business goals.
