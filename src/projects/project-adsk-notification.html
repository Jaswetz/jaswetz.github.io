              <h3>Discovery & Research</h3>
              <p>
                Recognizing Fusion's fragmented messaging hurt user engagement,
                I initiated an investigation. A thorough content inventory of
                existing notifications, affinity mapping, and review of the
                Autodesk Design System (Weave) and other products helped
                identify inconsistencies. User research highlighted key
                frustrations: overuse/repetition, bad content, difficult access,
                lack of user control, and too many channels.

              <h3>Framework Development & Design</h3>
              <p>
                I created a severity matrix and notification categories to guide
                delivery methods. After securing stakeholder buy-in, I moved
                from rapid sketches to high-fidelity designs using Weave
                components. This led to defining a centralized Notification
                Center, combining flyout and toast notifications, and exploring
                features like filtering, collapsible sections, and bulk actions,
                while addressing design challenges like filter scalability and
                visual clarity.

              <h3>User Testing & Iteration</h3>
              <p>
                Usability sessions were conducted to evaluate the current system
                and validate the new Notification Center concept. Key hypotheses
                around centralization, intuitiveness of flyouts/toasts, and
                workflow disruption were tested. Findings informed iterative
                improvements, prioritizing critical feedback for the initial
                version and deferring some enhancements.

            <h2 id="centralized-solution">A Centralized Solution</h2>
            <p>
              My work successfully transformed Fusion's notifications from a
              source of user frustration into a strategic communication tool. I
              designed a centralized notification center that reduced user
              distraction. Coupled with clear guidelines and prioritization
              strategies, this demonstrably reduced user distraction and
              improved the overall clarity of in-app messaging. The solution
              involved high-severity messages appearing as toasts, less critical
              ones stored in a flyout, and intermediate messages briefly
              appearing as toasts before moving to the flyout, minimizing
              workflow disruption.

              <li>
                The critical importance of a unified messaging strategy was
                underscored; fragmented systems invariably lead to user
                frustration and missed business opportunities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Iterative design, strongly backed by comprehensive user research
                and continuous stakeholder buy-in, is paramount when redesigning
                complex systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developing and providing clear guidelines alongside reusable
                design components significantly empowers other teams, fostering
                consistency and efficiency across the product ecosystem.
              </li>
              <li>
                A deep understanding of user pain points through direct research
                and analytics is fundamental to designing solutions that
                genuinely improve user experience and achieve business goals.
