                        <p>
                            As the lead UX designer, I was responsible for the project's launch, UX vision, and strategy, as well as overseeing user research and collaborating closely with a project manager (who joined later) and two developers. I also proactively gathered feedback from UX designers across other Autodesk teams to ensure broader alignment.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>The critical issues that current notifications caused were:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>User Experience:</strong> The inconsistent volume of notifications disrupted workflows, creating an overwhelming experience. Users struggled to prioritize information and efficiently manage in-app communication.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Business Impact:</strong> Key communications, particularly those related to subscriber acquisition, were being lost in the noise, significantly reducing their impact on business goals.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Product Perception:</strong> The lack of a cohesive notification experience detracted from the perceived quality and coherence of Autodesk Fusion, presenting an unpolished and fragmented appearance.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Internal Friction:</strong> The absence of a unified notification strategy increased development complexity and led to redundant implementation efforts, making the notification system difficult to manage and evolve.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                        <p>
                            The primary objective was to transform Fusion's messaging system from a source of frustration into a strategic asset. This involved:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>User Goal:</strong> Significantly reduce notification fatigue and distraction by creating a clear, consistent, and predictable system for receiving and managing messages.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Business Goal:</strong> Increase the visibility and effectiveness of critical communications, especially growth messaging.

                            <p>
                                The new notification system significantly addressed a critical need within Fusion, quickly establishing me as the in-house notification expert and mentor. My solutions and guidance became a key resource for fellow UX Designers, with weekly consultations to address in-product messaging questions across various new features and products. This initiative delivered significant results, including:

                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Process</h3>
                        <h4>Discovery</h4>
                        <p>
                            Recognizing the increasing negative impact of Fusion's fragmented messaging, I initiated a proactive investigation. Analyzing available analytics data, I observed a significant drop-off in user engagement with banner notifications, suggesting they were often overlooked or dismissed. This, combined with anecdotal feedback and peer discussions, confirmed a critical need for a unified notification strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I began by conducting a comprehensive content inventory of existing notifications. I started the process myself before actively recruiting colleagues from various teams (UX and Development) to contribute via Mural. This collaborative approach ensured a broad perspective. I then organized these notifications into groups using affinity mapping, revealing patterns and inconsistencies, such as duplicate notifications and varying levels of importance.
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                            <img class="proj__img center"
                                 src="images/projects/autodesk-messaging/workshop-2.png"
                                 alt="Content audit of the existing notifications."
                                 loading="lazy">
                            <figcaption>Content audit of the existing notifications.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            To establish a solid foundation, I reviewed the existing notification components within the Autodesk Design System (Weave), noting the lack of clear guidelines for usage. I also researched notification strategies from other internal Autodesk products (like AutoCAD and Revit) and external applications, seeking best practices and innovative solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This research extended to analyzing all notification types, including emails, canvas notifications, OS notifications (which analytics showed were underutilized and inconsistent), and in-line messages, to ensure a holistic approach. My goal was to develop a framework that was both user-friendly and aligned with overall business objectives. We removed OS Notifications. From here I could also start thinking of a broader notification strategy beyond just the Notification Center and Banners. But lets stay on topic.
                        </p>

                        <h4>User Research</h4>
                        <p>I leveraged user forums and prior research to understand current user frustrations:</p>
                        <ul>

                                <strong>System messaging</strong>
                                alerts the user of important system-related issues or status. It’s initiated by the system and it’s not a result of the user’s actions.

                                <strong>Access messaging</strong>
                                appears when the user tries to access an item that’s not available to them. It may be because the record has been deleted, the user doesn’t have access, etc.

                        <h4>Scoping and Getting Stakeholder Engagement Buy-in</h4>
                        <p>
                            The concept for the Notification Center had been on my mind for some time. To refine it, I gathered feedback from UX designers and explored potential features. While I began with sketches, I quickly transitioned to high-fidelity designs, leveraging existing design system components and tools like auto layout for faster iteration and feedback.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To secure funding from the Growth Business group, <strong>I developed and delivered a compelling presentation to leadership, effectively securing buy-in by showcasing the project's strategic value.</strong> It emphasized how resolving the notification issues would directly benefit both users and the business, particularly in growth and marketing. Specifically, user research indicated that excessive notifications, especially banner notifications, were causing users to miss important information.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Design and Iteration</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Notification Center began as a complex concept, but through rapid sketching, prototyping, and feedback, I transformed it into a simple, scalable solution. I quickly transitioned from sketches to high-fidelity designs using existing design system components and auto layout, which allowed me to iterate faster and gather more actionable feedback. This approach helped me establish a clear and effective strategy to solve user challenges.

                        <h4>Defining the Solution</h4>
                        <p>
                            Weave provided two components: the notification flyout and the toast. My research revealed the need for a unified "Notification Center" that combined these elements into a centralized hub. This solution allowed users to access all notifications, including previously dismissed toasts, addressing the common frustration of missed alerts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To optimize the user experience, I assigned high-severity notifications to toasts for immediate visibility, while less critical messages were stored in the flyout with a subtle blue dot indicator. This separation minimized workflow disruptions, ensuring users could focus on critical tasks while reviewing less urgent messages at their convenience.
                        </p>

                                <strong>Filtering and Settings:</strong> Users could filter notifications by type, status (read/unread), and other criteria, offering greater control and customization.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Collapsible Sections:</strong> Notifications were grouped by time using accordions, with read markers indicating unread notifications for quick identification.

                                <strong>Filter Design:</strong> While tabs initially seemed intuitive, they were not scalable for adding future filters. A dropdown filter was chosen for flexibility and future-proofing.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Visual Clarity:</strong> To improve scannability, I incorporated consistent iconography, thumbnails for files, and profile pictures for user-generated notifications. Contextual icons (e.g., error, success, or warning) were overlaid on notification imagery, enabling users to quickly assess relevance and urgency.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Grouping by Time:</strong> Time was the most critical factor for organizing notifications. Using accordions allowed users to scan updates efficiently while keeping the interface clean.

                        <p>Our usability sessions focused on validating the following hypotheses:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Moving job status, service notifications, and product updates into a single Notification Center will provide users with a clearer, centralized point of reference.
                            </li>
                            <li>Adding a Flyout and Toasts is an intuitive approach aligned with users' mental models of notifications.</li>
                            <li>The new Flyout and Toast workflow will not disrupt the user's workflow.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Key Findings and Observations</h4>
                        <h4>Current Experience</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Job Status Discovery:</strong> All four users were unaware they could access Job Status via the "clock" icon. One user relied on a cumbersome workaround through specific workspaces. Three users didn’t recognize the "View Job Status" text in the expanded dialog as clickable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Banners:</strong> Banners were not perceived as overly invasive but were sometimes missed. Users felt banners took up valuable screen real estate when noticed. The "What’s New" banner was the most noticeable and often left open for later review.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Updates:</strong> Users valued knowing what an update included before installing it, especially for bug fixes or new features. Forced updates were disruptive when triggered at inopportune times.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Overall Reaction:</strong> Users responded positively to the new Notification Center, appreciating the centralized location for notifications. Most users felt they could easily find what they needed, though one expressed concerns about potential clutter despite filtering options.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Toast Notifications:</strong> Toasts were seen as intuitive and effective for confirming actions like downloads/uploads. All users successfully navigated from a toast to "View Details." One user initially thought an error occurred when a modal disappeared after clicking "Upload" but quickly understood the toast’s purpose.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Flyout Functionality:</strong> The bell icon was universally recognized for alerts. Users understood that activities were sorted chronologically. One user suggested consolidating rendering jobs into the Flyout. The funnel icon for filtering was unclear to one user.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Cancel Actions:</strong> Reactions to cancel functionality were mixed. Some users noticed individual file cancel options, while others only saw "Cancel All." One user noted that individual cancel buttons were too close together, increasing the risk of misclicks.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Notification Persistence:</strong> Users questioned how long notifications would remain in the Flyout and what actions would remove them.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Outcome</h4>
                        <p>
                            The results gave me confidence to move forward with our MVP. We prioritized critical feedback for v1, such as improving discoverability and clarity, while reserving additional improvements, like enhanced filtering and notification persistence, for v2.

                            To ensure consistent usage, I developed comprehensive guidelines for the Notification Center and banners, which were submitted to the platform team and became a key resource for product teams. These guidelines clarified appropriate usage, including when and why to use each. In addition to the guidelines, I also created Figma components for other teams to use, making the notification guidelines easier to follow and consistent.

                        <p>
                            To streamline notifications, I advocated for a centralized front-end and back-end system, replacing inconsistent implementations. A code audit, organized in Airtable, identified existing notifications and tracked their types and progress. This facilitated collaboration with development, ensuring efficient and high-quality delivery.

Jason was a great collaborative partner, leading our weekly meetings with fresh ideas and humility, ensuring we stayed aligned and on track. His work had a huge impact in centralizing in-product messages in Fusion’s Notification Center and improving how we organized critical updates for the user. As a developer, I really appreciated how well he bridged design and implementation.”

                        <h3>A Centralized Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            My work successfully transformed Fusion's notifications from a source of user frustration into a strategic communication tool. I designed a centralized notification center that reduced user distraction, coupled with clear guidelines and prioritization strategies, demonstrably reduced user distraction and improved the overall clarity of in-app messaging. Resulting in an increase in paid subscribers. The establishment of a scalable messaging framework and its integration into Autodesk's design system provides a lasting foundation for future product development and consistent user communication.
