# Portfolio Refactoring and Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive refactoring and optimization project for Jason Swetzoff's UX portfolio. The goal is to address critical performance issues, improve maintainability, and enhance user experience while preserving the excellent architectural foundation built with vanilla JavaScript Web Components and Cascade Layers CSS architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Critical Issue Resolution

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want the portfolio to load quickly and function properly, so that I can effectively view Jason's work without performance barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site loads THEN the JavaScript bundle SHALL be under 30KB gzipped (currently 158.4KB)
2. WHEN running tests THEN all failing integration tests SHALL pass (currently 105/551 failing)
3. WHEN checking security THEN all npm audit vulnerabilities SHALL be resolved
4. WHEN viewing case study pages THEN all page titles SHALL include "Jason Swetzoff" for consistency
5. WHEN using screen readers THEN all images SHALL have descriptive alt text
6. WHEN the analytics system loads THEN window.portfolioAnalytics SHALL be properly exposed and functional

### Requirement 2: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the portfolio to load quickly on my device, so that I can browse Jason's work without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring Core Web Vitals THEN LCP SHALL be under 2.5 seconds
2. WHEN loading pages THEN CLS SHALL be under 0.1
3. WHEN implementing code splitting THEN non-critical JavaScript SHALL load lazily using dynamic imports
4. WHEN caching is enabled THEN repeat visits SHALL load 50% faster through service worker implementation
5. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL use lazy loading with loading="lazy" and WebP format with fallbacks
6. WHEN running bundle size tests THEN npm run test:bundle-size SHALL pass with JS <30KB and CSS <70KB

### Requirement 3: CSS Architecture Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable CSS architecture, so that I can easily add new components and modify existing styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new components THEN CSS SHALL follow Cascade Layers architecture with exact order: @layer reset, base, theme, layout, components, utilities
2. WHEN updating themes THEN changes SHALL propagate through design tokens in src/css/variables.css
3. WHEN building for production THEN unused CSS SHALL be automatically removed by Parcel
4. WHEN writing styles THEN they SHALL follow BEM methodology within Shadow DOM and use rem units for mobile-first responsive design
5. WHEN reviewing code THEN CSS SHALL have clear documentation and maintain the established layer import order in src/css/main.css

### Requirement 4: HTML Standardization

**User Story:** As a search engine crawler, I want consistent, semantic HTML, so that I can properly index and rank the portfolio content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN crawling pages THEN all HTML SHALL follow consistent structure patterns using semantic elements: nav, main, section, article
2. WHEN parsing metadata THEN all pages SHALL have complete SEO tags including Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata
3. WHEN checking accessibility THEN all pages SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
4. WHEN using assistive technology THEN navigation SHALL be fully accessible with ARIA labels and 44px minimum touch targets
5. WHEN validating markup THEN all HTML SHALL be semantically correct with proper case study naming: project-[company]-[project].html

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Organization

**User Story:** As a future developer, I want clean, well-organized code, so that I can easily understand and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code THEN all ESLint warnings SHALL be resolved and npm run test SHALL pass
2. WHEN exploring the project THEN file organization SHALL follow the established structure with Web Components in src/js/components/[component-name]/ComponentName.js
3. WHEN reading documentation THEN it SHALL be comprehensive and up-to-date in /styleguide.html
4. WHEN running automated checks THEN code quality metrics SHALL meet standards with Lighthouse performance ≥90
5. WHEN adding new features THEN the architecture SHALL support easy extension through vanilla JavaScript Web Components extending HTMLElement

### Requirement 6: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that I can confidently deploy changes without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN Web Components SHALL have 80%+ coverage using Vitest with Happy DOM for Shadow DOM testing
2. WHEN testing accessibility THEN automated Playwright audits SHALL pass consistently with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. WHEN checking cross-browser compatibility THEN Chrome/Edge ≥63, Firefox ≥63, Safari ≥10.1 SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN regression tests SHALL catch degradations and maintain Core Web Vitals thresholds
5. WHEN deploying THEN all quality gates SHALL validate: npm run test, npm run test:bundle-size, and npx playwright test must pass

### Requirement 7: Security and Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the portfolio to be secure and up-to-date, so that my browsing experience is safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing dependencies THEN no high or critical vulnerabilities SHALL exist after running npm audit fix
2. WHEN implementing CSP THEN security headers SHALL be properly configured in public/\_headers with trusted sources
3. WHEN handling user input THEN proper validation SHALL be in place for password protection system
4. WHEN loading external resources THEN they SHALL be from trusted sources (Google Fonts, Google Analytics only)
5. WHEN updating dependencies THEN compatibility SHALL be maintained with Node.js 23.9.0 and Parcel.js 2.15.4

### Requirement 8: Analytics Simplification

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want simple, effective analytics, so that I can understand visitor behavior without impacting performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing analytics THEN the system SHALL be under 5KB total (replacing complex 8-module system)
2. WHEN tracking events THEN only essential metrics SHALL be collected: page views, project clicks, contact events
3. WHEN respecting privacy THEN GDPR compliance SHALL be maintained with user consent and localStorage sessions
4. WHEN loading analytics THEN it SHALL not block page rendering and load via dynamic imports
5. WHEN viewing reports THEN data SHALL provide actionable insights through simplified tracking focused on portfolio engagement
