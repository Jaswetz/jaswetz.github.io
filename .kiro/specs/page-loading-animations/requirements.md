# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add smooth, professional loading animations to all pages in Jason Swetzoff's UX portfolio. The loading animations will enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback during page transitions and initial page loads, while maintaining the portfolio's performance-first approach and accessibility standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio, I want to see smooth loading animations when pages load, so that I have visual feedback and the site feels more polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page starts loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading animation immediately
2. WHEN the page content is fully loaded THEN the system SHALL smoothly fade out the loading animation
3. WHEN the loading animation is active THEN the system SHALL prevent interaction with page content until loading is complete
4. WHEN a user has `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled THEN the system SHALL show minimal or no animation effects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor with accessibility needs, I want loading animations to respect my motion preferences, so that I can use the site comfortably without triggering motion sensitivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` set THEN the system SHALL use fade transitions instead of complex animations
2. WHEN loading animations are displayed THEN the system SHALL include appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers
3. WHEN the loading state changes THEN the system SHALL announce the state change to assistive technologies
4. WHEN animations are running THEN the system SHALL ensure they don't cause seizures or vestibular disorders

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious visitor, I want loading animations to be lightweight and fast, so that they don't negatively impact the site's performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading animations are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain the current performance budget (JS <30KB, CSS <70KB)
2. WHEN animations run THEN the system SHALL use CSS transforms and opacity for optimal performance
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL not delay the Largest Contentful Paint metric
4. WHEN animations are active THEN the system SHALL not cause layout shifts that affect CLS scores

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want consistent loading animations across all pages, so that the experience feels cohesive and professional throughout the portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any page loads THEN the system SHALL use the same loading animation style and timing
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL show loading animations for both internal and external navigation
3. WHEN loading animations appear THEN the system SHALL match the portfolio's visual design language
4. WHEN animations complete THEN the system SHALL reveal content in a way that feels natural and smooth

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want loading animations to work smoothly on my device, so that I have the same quality experience regardless of my device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading animations run on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance
2. WHEN animations are displayed on touch devices THEN the system SHALL prevent accidental interactions during loading
3. WHEN loading on slower connections THEN the system SHALL show appropriate feedback for longer load times
4. WHEN animations run on various screen sizes THEN the system SHALL scale appropriately for different viewports
