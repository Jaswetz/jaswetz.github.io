# Case Study Navigation Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The case study pages (specifically `project-adsk-notification.html`) have a sidebar navigation menu that allows users to jump to different sections of the case study. Currently, there are two main issues affecting the user experience:

1. The scroll spy functionality doesn't properly highlight navigation links when scrolling to certain sections (specifically "The Problem" section)
2. When clicking navigation links, the section headers appear too low on the page due to improper scroll offset calculations

This feature aims to fix these navigation issues to provide a smooth, intuitive browsing experience for users reading case studies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Accurate Scroll Spy Highlighting

**User Story:** As a user reading a case study, I want the sidebar navigation to accurately highlight the current section I'm viewing, so that I can easily track my progress through the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls to any section with an ID THEN the corresponding navigation link SHALL be highlighted with an "active" class
2. WHEN a user scrolls to "The Problem" section THEN the "The Problem" navigation link SHALL be highlighted correctly
3. WHEN a user scrolls between sections THEN only one navigation link SHALL be active at a time
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the first visible section's navigation link SHALL be highlighted by default
5. IF a user navigates directly to a section via URL hash THEN the corresponding navigation link SHALL be highlighted immediately

### Requirement 2: Proper Scroll Positioning

**User Story:** As a user navigating through a case study, I want section headers to appear at an optimal position when I click navigation links, so that I can easily read the content without having to manually adjust my scroll position.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a navigation link THEN the target section header SHALL appear with appropriate top margin/padding
2. WHEN a user clicks any navigation link THEN the section header SHALL NOT be hidden behind the site header or appear too low on the page
3. WHEN smooth scrolling occurs THEN the final scroll position SHALL account for fixed header height and provide comfortable reading spacing
4. WHEN a user clicks a navigation link THEN the scroll position SHALL be consistent across all sections

### Requirement 3: Consistent Navigation Behavior

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the case study navigation, I want consistent and predictable behavior across all navigation interactions, so that I can efficiently browse the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a navigation link THEN smooth scrolling SHALL be applied consistently
2. WHEN navigation links are clicked in rapid succession THEN each click SHALL properly cancel previous scroll animations
3. WHEN the browser back/forward buttons are used THEN the navigation highlighting SHALL update correctly
4. WHEN the page is resized THEN the scroll spy functionality SHALL continue to work accurately

### Requirement 4: Cross-Browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user accessing the portfolio from different browsers, I want the navigation functionality to work consistently, so that my experience is reliable regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is viewed in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge THEN all navigation functionality SHALL work identically
2. WHEN using different viewport sizes THEN the scroll calculations SHALL remain accurate
3. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the navigation links SHALL still function as standard anchor links
