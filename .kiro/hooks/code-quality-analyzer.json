Focus on:\n\n1. **Code Smells & Anti-patterns**:\n   - Long functions/methods that should be broken down\n   - Duplicate code that could be refactored\n   - Complex conditional logic that could be simplified\n   - Magic numbers/strings that should be constants\n   - Inconsistent naming conventions\n\n2. **Design Patterns & Architecture**:\n   - Opportunities to apply common design patterns\n   - Component structure improvements for Web Components\n   - CSS architecture alignment with project's cascade layers\n   - Module organization and dependency management\n\n3. **Best Practices**:\n   - Performance optimizations (lazy loading, efficient selectors)\n   - Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)\n   - Security considerations (XSS prevention, input validation)\n   - Browser compatibility issues\n   - Error handling and edge cases\n\n4. **Code Quality**:\n   - Readability improvements (comments, variable names)\n   - Maintainability enhancements\n   - Testing opportunities\n   - Documentation gaps\n\n**Important**: Only suggest improvements that maintain existing functionality. Provide specific, actionable recommendations with code examples where helpful. Consider the project's tech stack: Vanilla JS (ES2022), Web Components, CSS Cascade Layers, and Parcel.js bundler.",
