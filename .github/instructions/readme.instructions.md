- Continuously **capture all meaningful changes and decisions** in the `README.md`.
  - After implementing a new feature, update its description and usage examples.
  - After adjusting project configuration (e.g., bundler, CSS architecture), reflect it in the setup/docs section.
  - When structural or architectural decisions occur, briefly **explain the rationale** in the README.
- Keep README sections updated: **Installation**, **Usage**, **Development Workflow**, **Core Technologies**, **Accessibility Notes**, etc.
