## Content Maintenance

### Continuous Updates

- **Capture Changes**: Document all meaningful changes and decisions
- **Feature Implementation**: Update descriptions and usage examples after new features
- **Configuration Changes**: Reflect bundler, architecture, or tooling adjustments
- **Architecture Decisions**: Explain rationale for structural changes

### When to Update

- After implementing new features or components
- When changing build processes or dependencies
- After security updates or important fixes
- When adding new team members or changing workflows
- Before major releases or milestones
